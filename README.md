============

Boilerplate HTML + CSS + Javascript (with jQuery and a plugin) commented all to hell.

One of my biggest hurdles in web development was figuring out the "glue" between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Codecademy teaches syntax, but then what? 

This is a super basic app that uses a form, some jquery, and a small jquery plugin to build and append to list.
I built it for a friend of mine to help him get into web development.
I've made comments about what everything is doing that I hope are helpful.
